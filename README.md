# Protohackers solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the
[Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) programming challenges.

Each directory inside this repo contains the solution to each one of the
challenges as a standalone Rust crate. You can run each solution by running
`cargo run` inside its directory.

The `test.sh` script inside each directory deploys the solution to my server.

# Why?

For fun :P
